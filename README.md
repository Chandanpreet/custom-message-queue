## custom-message-queue
A custom message queue implementation.

### Problem statement
- Design a sample messaging queue having a producer and consumer (for example kafka).
- Your code should take care of multithreading/concurrency issues.
- Producer & consumer should operate independently.


For now only single producer and consumer are added but can be increased with few changes.
